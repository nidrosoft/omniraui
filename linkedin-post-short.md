I got tired of fighting bright UIs that hurt my eyes after 8 hours of screen time.

So I built my own design system from scratch.

Meet Omnira UI — a glassmorphism component library with a dark-first approach.

Here's the thing most design systems get wrong: they build for light mode first, then slap on a dark theme as an afterthought. The result? Poor contrast, inconsistent surfaces, and dark modes that feel broken.

Omnira flips that. Every component is designed in dark mode first — soft backgrounds, frosted glass surfaces, and a carefully tuned lime green accent (#D2FE17) that guides your eye without screaming at you. Then light mode is built as a true companion, not an inversion.

What's already built:
→ 30+ base components (Button, Input, Badge, Select, Toggle, Slider, Rating, and more)
→ 5 sidebar navigation variants (Simple, Dividers, Headings, Slim, Dual Panel)
→ 12 feature cards (Progress, Onboarding, Upgrade, Referral, and more)
→ 1,000+ icons via iconsax-react
→ Full documentation with live previews and copy-pasteable code
→ Every component works. Every code block you copy actually runs.

The stack:
Next.js 16 · TypeScript · CSS Modules · CSS Custom Properties · Framer Motion

No Tailwind. Every design token is a CSS variable you own and control.

Coming soon:
→ Full theme customization (accent colors, border radius, shadows)
→ 10 color presets with a CLI tool to scaffold your project
→ Custom borders, rounded corners, spacing scales
→ Dashboard templates and more application UI
→ Targeting 1,000 components total

I'm a senior product designer & engineer at Intraopic. After using hundreds of apps and design systems, I wanted something that's premium out of the box, readable by default, and genuinely beautiful.

This is that project. Built in public. Shipping every week.
